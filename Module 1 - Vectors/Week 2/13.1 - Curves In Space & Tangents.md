Particles are defined by parametric functions of $t$
$x = f(t)$, $y = g(t)$, $z = h(t)$, $t \in I$
where $I$ is the time interval the particle moves in
The vector $r(t) = \vec{OP} = f(t)i + g(t)j + h(t)k$  from the origin is the position vector of the particle.
	$f,g,h$ are **component functions** of the position vector
$r(t)$ is a vector-valued function because it returns a vector
The domain, $I$ is the largest set of points $t$ for which all three equations are defined, or $-\infty < t< \infty$
## Limits of Vector-Valued functions
Let $r(t) = f(t)i + g(t)j + h(t)k$ be a vector function with domain $D$, and let $L$ be a vector. We say that $r$ has **limit** $L$ as $t$ approaches $t_{0}$ and write
$$
\lim_{ t \to t_{0} } r(t) = L 
$$
if, for every number $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a corresponding number $\delta > 0$ such that, for all $t \in D$,
$$
|r(t) - L| < \epsilon \text{  whenever  } 0< |t-t_{0}|<\delta
$$
A vector function $r(t)$ is **continuous at a point** $t = t_{0}$ is and only if each component function is continuous there
A vector function is **continuous** if it is continuous at every point in its domain

## Derivative of Vector Valued Functions
The vector function $r(t) = f(t)i + g(t)j + h(t)k$ has a **derivative** (is differentiable) at $t$ if $f,g,$ and $h$ have derivatives at $t$. The derivative is the vector function
$$
r'(t) = \frac{dr}{dt} = \lim_{ \Delta t \to 0 } \frac{r(t+\Delta)-r(t)}{\Delta t}=\frac{df}{dt}i + \frac{dg}{dt}j + \frac{dh}{dt}k
$$
A vector function r is differentiable if it is differentiable at every point of its domain.

The curve traced by $r(t)$ is **smooth** if $\frac{dr}{dt}$ is continuous and never 0 ($f,g,h$ have continuous first derivatives and are never simultaneously 0)
A curve is **piecewise smooth** if it is both continuous and made up of smooth curves

### Velocity, Speed, Acceleration, Direction
#### Velocity
$$
v = \frac{dr}{dt}
$$
#### Speed
$$
\text{Speed } = |v|
$$
#### Acceleration
$$
a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^{2}r}{dt^{2}}
$$
#### Direction
$$
\text{Direction} = \frac{v}{|v|}
$$
### Differentiation Rules
See [[Differentiation Cheat Sheet]]

### Vectors of Constant Length
$$
\begin{aligned}
r(t) \cdot r(t) = |r(t)|^{2} &= c^{2}\\
\frac{d}{dt}[r(t) \cdot r(t)] &= 0\\
r'(t) \cdot r(t) + r(t) \cdot r'(t) &= 0\\
2r'(t) \cdot r(t) &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore, The $r(t)$ and $r'(t)$ are orthogonal 
If **r** is a differentiable vector function of $t$ and the length of $r(t)$ is constant, then $$r \cdot \frac{dr}{dt} = 0$$The converse is also true
