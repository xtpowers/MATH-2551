Line Segment = determined by point and slope
Slope = scalar for 2d, vector for 3d+

## Vector Eq. for a line
$$r(t)= r_{0}+tv$$
where $r$ is the position vector of a point $P(x,y,z)$ on $L$ and $r_{0}$ is the position vector of $P_{0}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$

## Detailed Vector Eq. for a Line
$$r(t)= r_{0}+t|v| \frac{v}{|v|}$$
where $|v|$ is the "direction" of the line, and $\frac{v}{|v|}$ is the "speed" of the line

## Distance from a point to a Line in Space
Where $P$ is a point on the line, $S$ is the point being tested, and $v$ is a vector parallel of the Plane
To get $\vec{PS}$, subtract $P$ from $S$
$$
d= \frac{|\vec{PS} \times v|}{|v|}
$$
## Eq. for a Plane in Space
The plane through $P_{0}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ normal to a nonzero vector $n = Ai+Bj+Ck$ has:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&n \cdot \vec{P_{0}P} = 0 \\
&A(x-x_{0})+B(y-y_{0})+C(z-z_{0})=0\\
&Ax + By + Cz = D\\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Distance from a Point to a Plane
Where $P$ is a point on the plane, $S$ is the point being tested, and $n$ is the normal vector of the Plane
$$
d = \left|\vec{PS} \cdot \frac{n}{|n|}\right|
$$
## Angle between two Planes
$$
\theta = \cos ^{-1}\left( \frac{n_{1} \cdot n_{2}}{|n_{1} | | n_{2}|} \right)
$$

## Properties of Lines
If $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are parallel, $L_{1} \times L_{2} = 0$
If $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are skew, $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ lie in parallel planes, so their planes have the same normal vector
