A **Cylinder** is a surface made by moving a line parallel to a line along a **curve**
this curve is called the **generating curve**

## Quadric Surfaces
A **Quadric Surface** is the graph of a second degree equation in x,y,z
Basic Quadric Surfaces:
- ellipsoids
- paraboloids
- elliptical cones
- hyperboloids
### Ellipsoid
$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} + \frac{z^{2}}{c^{2}} = 1
$$
If 2 of the semiaxes are equal: the surface is an **ellipsoid of revolution**
If all 3 are equal: the surface is a **sphere**
### Hyperbolic Paraboloid
$$
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} - \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = \frac{z}{c}, c>0
$$

### General Quadric Surfaces
General Equation:
$Ax^{2} + By^{2} + Cz^{2} + Dxy + Exy + Fxy + Gz + Hy+ Iz+ J =0$
Terms G,H, and I are translations, and are found by completing the square
