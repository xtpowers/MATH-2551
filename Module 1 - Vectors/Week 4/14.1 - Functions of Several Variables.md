## Domain and Range
Define a set of $n$-tuples in $\mathbb{R}^n$: $D = (x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\dots x_{n})$
A real-valued function $f$ on $D$ has $w$ such that $w = f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\dots x_{n})$
In this case, $D$ is the domain, and $w$ is the range

Inputs that lead to a divide by zero of imaginary numbers are excluded from the domain

Boundary point : on the boundary of a set
Interior point : fully contained in the set
	A region is **bounded** if it lies inside a disk of finite radius. A region is **unbounded** if it is not bounded.
## Graphs and Level Curves
The set of points where a function $f(x,y)$ has a constant value $c$ is a **level** curve of $f$
The set of all points $(x,y,f(x,y))$ in space for the domain of $f$ is the graph of $f$
Graph is also called the surface, $z = f(x,y)$

For functions of 2 variables: can't graph them effectively, but can see how they behave by looking at their level surfaces
