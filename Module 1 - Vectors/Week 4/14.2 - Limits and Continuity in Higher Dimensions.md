## Limits for Functions of Two Variables
Definition:
$$
\begin{gather}

\text{Suppose that every open circular disk centered at } (x_{0}, y_{0}) \text{ contains a point in}\\ \text{ the domain of } f \text{ other than }(x_{0},y_{0})\text{ itself}.\\
\lim_{ (x,y) \to (x_{0},y_{0}) }f(x,y) = L\\
\text{ if, for every number }\epsilon>0 \text{, there exists a corresponding number }\\ \delta>0 \text{ such that for all } (x,y) \text{ in the domain of } f,\\
|d(x,y) - L| <\epsilon \text{ whenever } 0< \sqrt{ rt(x-x_{0})^{2}+(y-y_{0})^{2}}<\delta
\end{gather}

## Continuity
Definition:
A function $f(x,y)$ is continuous at the point $(x_{0},y_{0})$ if
1. $f$ is defined at $(x_0, y_0)$
2. $\lim_{ x,y) \to (x_{0},y_{0}) }f(x,y)$ exists, and
3. $\lim_{ x,y) \to (x_{0},y_{0}) }f(x,y)  = f(x_{0},y_{0})$
A function is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain.

If $f$ is continuous at $(x_{0},y_{0})$ and $g$ is a single-variable function continuous at $f(x_{0},y_{0})$, then the composition $h = g \circ f$ defined by $h(x,y) = g(f(x,y))$ is also continuous at $(x_{0},y_{0})$.

## EVT
Extreme Value Theorem holds on higher dimension functions if the domain is closed and bounded.
