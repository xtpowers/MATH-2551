As a particle moves along a smooth curve, $T=\frac{dr}{dt}$ turns as the curve bends
The rate at which $T$ turns is the curvature, where $s$ is arc length, which is given by:
$$
\begin{gather}
\kappa=\left|\frac{dT}{ds}\right|\\
\kappa= \frac{1}{|v|} \left| \frac{dT}{dt}\right|
\end{gather}
$$
A straight line has a curvature of 0.
## Principal Unit Normal
The unit vector $N$ orthogonal to $T$ is the principal unit normal. Because $|T|=1$, it's derivative is orthogonal to $T$. Dividing $\frac{dT}{ds}$ by its length $\kappa$ gives $N$
$$
\begin{gather}
N=\frac{1}{\kappa} \frac{dT}{ds}\\
N=\frac{dT/dt}{|dT/dt|}
\end{gather}
$$
## Circle of Curvature
The circle of curvature at point $P$ on a plane curve where $\kappa \neq 0$ is the circle in the plane of the curve that:
1. is tangent to the curve at $P$
2. has the same curvature that the curve has at $P$
3. has center that lies on the concave side of the curve
The radius of curvature of the curve is the radius of the circle of curvature
$$
\text{Radius of curvature } = \rho = \frac{1}{\kappa}
$$
The center of curvature is at the center of the circle of curvature
## Curvature of a function
$$
\kappa(x) = \frac{|f''(x)|}{[1+(f'(x))^2]^{\frac{3}{2}}}
$$
