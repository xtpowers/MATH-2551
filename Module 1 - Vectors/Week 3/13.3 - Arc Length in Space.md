## Arc Length Along a Space Curve
Length of a curve $r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k$, $a \leq t \leq b$, that is traced exactly once as $t$ increases from $t = a$ to $t=b$ is
$$
L =\int ^b_{a}\sqrt{ \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2+\left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^{2} +\left( \frac{dz}{dt} \right)^{2}} \, dt 
$$
$$
L = \int _{a}^b|v| \, dt 
$$
## Speed on a Smooth Curve
$$
\frac{ds}{dt} = |v(t)|
$$
### Unit Tangent Vector
$$
T = \frac{v}{|v|}
$$
