## Differentiation Rules
| Rule Name | Definition |
| ---- | ---- |
| Constant Function Rule | $$\frac{d}{dt}C = 0$$ |
| Scalar Multiple Rule | $$\frac{d}{dt}[cu(t)] = cu'(t)$$ |
| Sum Rule | $$\frac{d}{dt}[u(t) + v(t)] = u'(t) + v'(t)$$ |
| Product Rule | $$\frac{d}{dt}[f(t)u(t)] = f'(t)u(t) + f(t)  u'(t)$$ |
| Dot Product Rule | $$\frac{d}{dt}[u(t) \cdot v(t)] = u'(t) \cdot v(t) + u(t) \cdot v'(t)$$ |
| Cross Product Rule | $$\frac{d}{dt}[u(t) \times v(t)] = u'(t) \times v(t) + u(t) \times v'(t)$$ |
| Quotient Rule | $$\frac{d}{dt}[f(t)/u(t)] = \frac{u(t)f'(t) = f(t)u'(t)}{u(t)^{2}}$$ |
| Chain Rule | $$\frac{d}{dt}[u(f(t)))] = f'(t)u'(f(t))$$ |
